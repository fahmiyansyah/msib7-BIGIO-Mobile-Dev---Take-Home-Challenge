# Rick and Morty Character App

# Introduction

This project is a MSIB batch 7 test at BIGIO Company which contains a mobile application that allows users to browse and search for characters from the popular TV show Rick and Morty. The application uses the Rick and Morty API to retrieve character data and display it in an easy-to-use interface.

# Probleam

In this project I want to use different pinch on character detail. But I found a problem that I can't solve about the difference in datatype that I never found where the problem is. So I use another method but still leave the previous method code as a reference and improvement.
